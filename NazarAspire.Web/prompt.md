# Context for LLM Prompt

This project is a Node Based Application written in Blazor. It includes various components and services to create, manage, and visualize nodes and their connections. The application leverages Blazor for building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It also integrates with several libraries and services to provide a rich user experience.

The application structure includes:
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements.
- **Pages**: Different views of the application.
- **Services**: Backend services for data processing and business logic.
- **Diagrams**: Visual representation of nodes and their connections.

This context is used to generate prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in various tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation.

Use this context when interacting with LLMs in other applications and in Aider.

## Writing Code with Comments and Explanations

When writing code, always include comments and explanations to make the code more understandable. This helps other developers (and your future self) to quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the code. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Function and Method Comments**: Describe what the function or method does, its parameters, and its return value.
2. **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
3. **Class and Module Comments**: Provide an overview of the class or module, including its purpose and any important details.
